	Below are notes about the project...
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Write a RAM disk device driver that registers it as block device
		\item Using the crypto API, add encryption to the block device such that the device driver encrypts and decrypts data when it is written and read
		\item This will be developed in the drivers/block directory
		\item This will need to be a module, in order to use a module parameter.
		\item The module must then be moved in to the running VM. Kevin recommends scp.
		\item This is a block cypher, there may be more data than fits in one block of the cypher.
		\item The key must be set as a module parameter
		\item An incorrect key must produce gibberish
		\item Create an ext2 file system on the block device (mkfs.ext2).
	\end{enumerate}
